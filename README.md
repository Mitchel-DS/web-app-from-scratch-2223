# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 2021 - 2022

In this course you will learn to build a web application without frameworks or unnecessary libraries, but with vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript as much as possible. The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA). Data will be retrieved from an external API, manipulated and finally shown in the UI of the App. You will learn to apply interface principles when building and testing the interface. With the gained knowledge you will be able to build interactive prototypes, based on a user story and real data. Also you will gain a better understanding of how API's, frameworks and libraries work.

<!-- ☝️ replace this description with a description of your own work -->

In this project I will be making a web app that shows the collection of the Rijksmuseum. The user can search for a specific object and filter the objects by category. The user can also click on an object to see more information about the object.
